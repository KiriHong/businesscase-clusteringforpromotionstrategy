Data file is BathSoap.xls. 
The data in the Table 1 below profiles each household each row contains the
data for one household.

Though not used in this analysis project, two additional datasets were used in the derivation of the summary
data.


"CRISAPurchaseData" is a transaction database in which each row is a transaction. Multiple rows in
this dataset corresponding to a single household were consolidated into a single row of household data
in "CRISASummaryData".

The Durables sheet in the data file contains information used to calculate the affluence index. Each
row corresponds to a household, and each column represents a durable consumer good. A 1 in a column
indicates that the durable is possessed by the household; a 0 indicates that it is not possessed. This
value is multiplied by the weight assigned to the durable item. The sum of all the weighted values of
the durables possessed gives the affulence index.
